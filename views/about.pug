        .about-bio
          p My career path has taken me from counseling psychology to customer support, then manual QA, and now Quality Engineering and learning JavaScript. The through line is: I care about people and try to bring that energy to everything I do. In QE this manifests as advocating for accessibility, being a voice for customers in the development cycle, and making space for myself and other women and POC in tech.
          p Outside of work, I currently live in sunny southern California with my husband and our two rescue dogs. We're all obsessed with the NBA and watch it non-stop. I've also recently decided to take up backpacking, and I spend a lot of my free time watching related YouTube videos (gear reviews, how to pack, what to cook, and most importantly how to go to the bathroom in the woods).

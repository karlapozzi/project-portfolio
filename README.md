# Create a Portfolio using Node.js and Express
 
My sixth Treehouse Techdegree project: A portfolio showcasing the projects we've created so far in Treehouse. Node.js, Express, and Pug will be used to set up a server and handle requests (+ errors) in this back end project. 

I am going for an exceeds expectations grade, so this project includes the following customizations as well: 
- Animation when hovering over project cells
- Background color change behind project cells
- Text color changes when hovering over buttons with links
- All links open in a new tab
